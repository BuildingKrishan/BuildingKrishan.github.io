<p> Chess is my favourite timepass and game. With chess popularity rising in India exponentially, chess industry can become big. In Chess PlayBoard the player can play against the computer physically without straining its eyes. Player plays its moves and in return the computer tells the player to play particular move according to its algorithm. Each chess piece has unique id and on moving a piece to a square the sensor below block senses the piece noting down its location, then through a computer generated voice it instructs its move whic the player itself moves. So here the player moves both the side's move. There are many finer details that can be added to make this a good product however cost may be a issue.</p>
