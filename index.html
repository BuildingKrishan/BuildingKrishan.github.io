<img id='image' src='chess.jpeg' alt='chess board' width=400>

<div class="paras"><p align='justify'> Chess is my favourite timepass and game. With chess popularity rising in India exponentially, chess industry can become big. In Chess PlayBoard the player can play against the computer physically without straining its eyes. Player plays its moves and in return the computer tells the player to play particular move according to its algorithm. Each chess piece has unique id and on moving a piece to a square the sensor below block senses the piece noting down its location, then through a computer generated voice it instructs its move which the player itself moves. So here the player moves both the side's move. There are many finer details that can be added to make this a good product, however cost may be a issue.</p></div>

<div class='whole'><div class='thehead' id='marhead'><h2 >Marriage Drive </h2></div>
<img id='image' src='marriage.jpg' alt='marriage' width=400>
<div class="paras"><p align='justify'>Marriage is a big celebration in our country, we have large and beautiful weddings happening everyday. I have devised a concept of giving pendrives of the marriage as gifts. I ponder that in these celebrations we distribute sweets that has led to high diabetes patient count in India. So we can instead give personalised videos as well as photos of marriage to everyone in pendrives which everyone can enjoy. This will employ facial recognition technology and Artificial Intelligence to find all videos involving that person and good photos. This would not be a costly choice and will bring joy to everyone as they can rejoice the wedding at their home again.<p>

<div class='whole'><div class='thehead' id='sitehead'><h2 >E-Commerce</h2></div>
<img id='image' src='ecommerce.jpg' alt='e-commerce site' width=400 height=270>
<div class="paras"><p align='justify'> E-Commerce is one of the biggest industry and some people have hit gold here and earned billions of dollars. In this space we can create a user-business friendly market where the buyer can buy goods directly from nearby local shopkeeper whom he trusts and personally knows. Buyer can directly order or persionally buy and inquire from any shop nearby. In this system there is bound to be fairer trade and strong feedback system. This will not only help in giving human accountability but a very short delivery time. Also the delivery time can be converted into some minutes if appropriate partnership is struck with companies like swiggy, zomato. </p></div></div>
